===========

Tools for integrating macvim with Skim.app

INSTALLATION
------------
Easiest way: run `macvim-skim-install.sh`.  By default, installs a shell script
to your `~/bin/` directory, installs the latest `Skim.app` if it's not already
installed, and puts `WhichTab.vim` in your plugins directory.

If you want to install manually, Copy macvim-skim to `~/.vim/plugins/`.  Put
`macvim-load-line` on your path.
